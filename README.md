# Size Matcher API

The **Size Matcher API** is a Flask-based web application designed to help users find equivalent clothing sizes across various brands. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, the API allows users to input their known size in one brand (e.g., "Nike Medium") and receive recommendations for equivalent sizes in another brand. This API is ideal for integration into e-commerce platforms, fashion websites, or mobile apps.
